        I believe growth is the most important part of any journey. In my career journey in UX/UI, I approach each day as an opportunity to learn, adapt, and evolve. I'm an open book, ready to absorb new knowledge and refine my skills along the way.

                I’ve always felt that IT chose me, rather than the other way around. 
                My journey started about three years ago when I began learning to code and exploring how computers work.
                What initially fascinated me was understanding why apps look and function the way they do, which led me to focus on front-end development.
                As I built my skills, I became captivated by the creative side of technology, from user interface design to seamless app interactions.
                After a few classes, I was introduced to UX and UI design—and that’s where I found my true passion. 
                This field perfectly combines my interests in creativity, psychology, and problem-solving. With a keen eye for design and a desire to improve user experiences, I found my place in tech. UX/UI is about more than aesthetics; it’s about understanding user needs and creating valuable, intuitive experiences.
